/**
Timeouts are used you don't want your program to wait forever
for something like a network request, slow computation, or message.

go has :
	1. time.After
	2. context.WithTimeout

time.After -->	This is useful when youâ€™re waiting for something via a
				channel, but want to give up after a certain time.

context.WithTimeout --> This is the preferred way for managing timeouts, especially in APIs,
						web servers, and tasks that should be cancelable.
